Hello! Thank you so much for reviewing our CS32 final project! Our code takes the name of a drug, either its common name like Advil or scientific name like Ibuprofen and outputs the interactions it has with foods and other drugs. It does this by searching for the drug's Wikipedia page and then extracting the "Interactions" section. It then uses an API to connect with ChatGPT (Turbo 3.5) and request ChatGPT to "please summarize the key interaction-related information in one clear paragraph." Our code also does string processing on the extracted Wikipedia page to categorize the various interactions into interactions with either fruits or vegetables since these are foods people tend to think are "good" to eat when they are sick. But it is important for users to be aware of the potentially negative interactions.
Running our code is simple --- just type in the name of the medication you are taking/interested in when prompted by the computer. Typing in either the common drug name or the scientific name will both work. And then review the important information it ouputs!
Thank you and have a great summer break!
